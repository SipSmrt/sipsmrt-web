      <h2>Recommended Hydration Levels</h2>
      <p>
        Hydration needs vary significantly by age, activity level, and environment. General guidelines from the National Academies of Sciences recommend:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Men:</strong> Approximately 125 ounces (3.7 liters) daily.</li>
        <li><strong>Women:</strong> Approximately 91 ounces (2.7 liters) daily.</li>
        <li><strong>Children (ages 4-13):</strong> Between 57 to 81 ounces (1.7-2.4 liters) daily.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Factors such as exercise, heat, and medical conditions can increase these needs substantially (Mayo Clinic, 2023).
      </p>

      <h3>Benefits of Staying Hydrated</h3>
      <p>
        Proper hydration has extensive benefits, impacting both physical health and cognitive function:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Function:</strong> Adequate hydration can improve cognitive performance by up to 14%, including better memory, attention, and problem-solving skills (Journal of Nutrition, 2019).</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Performance:</strong> Staying hydrated can enhance athletic endurance by 18% and reduce fatigue significantly (Sports Medicine Research, 2021).</li>
        <li><strong>Mood Improvement:</strong> Proper hydration can positively influence mood, reducing anxiety and stress (Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 2018).</li>
        <li><strong>Metabolic Health:</strong> Drinking enough water supports digestion, nutrient absorption, and weight management (Clinical Nutrition, 2020).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Risks of Dehydration</h3>
      <p>
        Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluids than consumed, with consequences ranging from mild discomfort to severe health risks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Decline:</strong> Mild dehydration (just 1-2% of body water loss) can impair cognitive performance by up to 12% (Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, 2022).</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Health:</strong> Dehydration increases the risk of kidney stones, urinary tract infections, and constipation (American Kidney Fund, 2023).</li>
        <li><strong>Cardiovascular Strain:</strong> Even mild dehydration thickens blood, increasing the workload on the heart and raising blood pressure (American Heart Association, 2022).</li>
        <li><strong>Prevalence:</strong> Approximately 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated, often without realizing it (CDC, 2023).</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        “Regularly monitoring and maintaining hydration can prevent many health issues before they arise.”

      <h3>Hydration Across Different Life Stages</h3>
      <p>
        Hydration is critical at every life stage:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Children:</strong> Proper hydration improves concentration and academic performance (Pediatrics Journal, 2021).</li>
        <li><strong>Adults:</strong> Hydration enhances workplace productivity by 10-15% (Occupational Medicine, 2020).</li>
        <li><strong>Seniors:</strong> Reduces risks of confusion, falls, and hospitalizations by approximately 30% (Journal of Gerontology, 2022).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Practical Tips for Staying Hydrated</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Drink small amounts of water consistently throughout the day.</li>
        <li>Increase intake during exercise and in hot or humid climates.</li>
        <li>Eat foods with high water content such as fruits and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Use hydration monitoring apps or devices to track your daily intake accurately.</li>
      </ul>
